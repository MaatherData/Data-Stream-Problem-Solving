 Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Everyday Challenge: Making sense of nonsense, one weird pattern at a time.

Welcome to the madness â€” this beast of a repo is about to unload every single detail living inside it. Code? Explained. Logic? Exposed. Sanity? Long gone.

Solution:

ðŸ§  Computational Thinking
Read the input (space-separated candle heights)

Find the maximum height (tallest candle)

Count how many candles have that height

Return the count



ðŸ’» coding

input_text = input("Enter candle heights (space separated): ")


candle_heights = input_text.split()
numbers = []
i = 0
while i < len(candle_heights):
    numbers.append(int(candle_heights[i]))
    i = i + 1


tallest = numbers[0]  # start with the first number
i = 1
while i < len(numbers):
    if numbers[i] > tallest:
        tallest = numbers[i]
    i = i + 1


count = 0
i = 0
while i < len(numbers):
    if numbers[i] == tallest:
        count = count + 1
    i = i + 1


print(count)
